### Hi there, curious wanderer 👋 I'm Masha! 

My portfolio is currently baking in the data oven — still rising, not quite ready to serve.
Most of my work is locked away in private repos (top secret stuff 🕵️‍♀️), but I’ll be adding more examples soon — stay tuned!

In the meantime, feel free to check out the projects in the `r-projects` repo pinned below, and keep an eye out for upcoming SQL and Python examples.

Handcrafted with love, data, and maybe just a tiny bit of corgi fluff. 💛
