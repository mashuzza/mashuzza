### Hi there, curious wanderer 👋 I'm Masha! 

My portfolio is currently baking in the data oven — still rising, not quite ready to serve.
Most of my work is locked away in private repos (top secret stuff 🕵️‍♀️), but I’ll be adding some examples soon — stay tuned!

In the meantime, enjoy this placeholder message. It’s handcrafted with love and zero AI (probably). 💛
